        "Q1- What is hypothesis testing in statistics?\n",
        "\n",
        "A1- Hypothesis testing in statistics is a method used to make decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data. It involves testing an assumption (called a hypothesis) about a population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2-What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis\n",
        "\n",
        "A2- The null hypothesis (H₀) is a default or starting assumption in statistical testing that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables. It’s what you try to test against with your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Ha) is the statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It proposes that there is an effect, a difference, or a relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3- What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?\n",
        "\n",
        "A3-The significance level in hypothesis testing, usually denoted by α (alpha), is the threshold for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis. It represents the probability of making a Type I error, which means rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4- What does a P-value represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A4- In hypothesis testing, the p-value (probability value) represents the probability of observing your sample data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis (H₀) is true\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5- How do you interpret the P-value in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A5-The p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed results (or more extreme), assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6-What are Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A6-In hypothesis testing, Type I and Type II errors are two kinds of mistakes that can occur when making a decision about the null hypothesis (H₀):\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7-What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test in hypothesis testing\n",
        "\n",
        "A7-A one-tailed test checks for an effect in one direction (e.g., greater than or less than), while a two-tailed test checks for an effect in both directions\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8- What is the Z-test, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A8- A Z-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between sample and population means (or between two sample means), assuming the population standard deviation is known.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it's used: The population standard deviation (σ) is known.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sample size is large (typically 𝑛 ≥ 30 n≥30), or the data is normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9- How do you calculate the Z-score, and what does it represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A9- The Z-score tells you how many standard errors the sample mean is away from the population mean under the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "A high absolute Z-score indicates the sample mean is far from the population mean, which may lead to rejecting 𝐻 0 H 0​.\n",
        "\n",
        "You compare the Z-score to critical values (e.g., ±1.96 for a 5% significance level in a two-tailed test) to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10- What is the T-distribution, and when should it be used instead of the normal distributionQ\n",
        "\n",
        "A10- The T-distribution, also known as the Student's t-distribution, is a probability distribution similar to the normal distribution but with heavier tails. It is used when dealing with small sample sizes or when the population standard deviation is unknown, making it an alternative to the normal distribution (z-distribution) in these scenarios. When to use the T-distribution: Small sample sizes: When the sample size is less than 30, the t-distribution is preferred. Unknown population standard deviation: When the standard deviation of the population is not known and needs to be estimated from the sample data, the t-distribution is used. Estimating population parameters: The t-distribution is used to estimate population parameters, such as the population mean, when the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11- What is the difference between a Z-test and a T-test?\n",
        "\n",
        "A11- The key difference between a Z-test and a T-test lies in the sample size and the knowledge of the population standard deviation. Z-tests are typically used with large sample sizes (n > 30) and known population standard deviation, while T-tests are used with smaller sample sizes (n < 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown\n",

        "\n",
        "Q13- What is the relationship between Z-test and T-test in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A13- Z-test vs T-test: Formula, ExamplesThe Z-test and T-test are both hypothesis testing procedures used to determine if there's a significant difference between sample means, but they differ in their assumptions and when they're most appropriate to use\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14- What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results?\n",
        "\n",
        "A14- A confidence interval (CI) is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the true population parameter (like a mean or proportion) with a certain level of confidence—commonly 95%.\n",
        "\n",
        "How It's Used: It helps you estimate the population parameter, not just test it.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a 95% CI of (48, 52) for average height means you are 95% confident the true average lies between 48 and 52.\n",
        "\n",
        "In hypothesis testing, if the null value (e.g., a population mean of 50) falls outside the CI, you can reject the null hypothesis at the corresponding significance level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15- What is the margin of error, and how does it affect the confidence interval?\n",
        "\n",
        "A15- The margin of error represents the potential inaccuracy in an estimate, while the confidence interval provides a range within which the true population value is likely to fall. The margin of error directly affects the width of the confidence interval, and a larger margin of error leads to a wider interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16- How is Bayes' Theorem used in statistics, and what is its significance?\n",
        "\n",
        "A16- Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental statistical concept used to update the probability of a hypothesis when new evidence is observed. It allows for revising prior beliefs based on new information, making it crucial in areas like machine learning, medical diagnosis, and decision-making under uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17- What is the Chi-square distribution, and when is it used?\n",
        "\n",
        "A17- The Chi-square distribution (χ² distribution) is a statistical distribution that arises when you sum the squares of independent standard normal random variables. It is widely used in hypothesis testing and inferential statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18- What is the Chi-square goodness of fit test, and how is it applied?\n",
        "\n",
        "A18- The Chi-square goodness-of-fit test determines how well a sample's distribution fits a theoretical (expected) distribution. It's used to assess if observed data is consistent with a hypothesized distribution. Essentially, it compares observed frequencies with expected frequencies, quantifying the difference. How it's applied:\n",
        "\n",
        "Hypothesis: Formulate a hypothesis about the population distribution (e.g., data follows a normal distribution).\n",
        "Observed vs. Expected: Divide the data into categories and calculate observed frequencies. Then, calculate expected frequencies based on the hypothesized distribution.\n",
        "Q19- What is the F-distribution, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A19- The F-distribution is a probability distribution used in hypothesis testing, particularly when comparing variances or testing the equality of means in multiple samples, according to Number Analytics and Six Sigma Study Guide. It's a continuous distribution that is positively skewed and has two sets of degrees of freedom. The F-distribution is essential for determining the statistical significance of differences between groups, especially in analysis of variance (ANOVA\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20- What is an ANOVA test, and what are its assumptions?\n",
        "\n",
        "A20- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to compare means across multiple groups (typically 3 or more) to determine if at least one group mean is significantly different from the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21- What are the different types of ANOVA tests?\n",
        "\n",
        "A21- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests are used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if there are statistically significant differences between them. The two main types of ANOVA are one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA, distinguished by the number of independent variables they examine. One-way ANOVA examines the effect of a single independent variable on a dependent variable, while two-way ANOVA investigates the effects of two or more independent variables on a dependent variable.\n",

        "Q22-What is the F-test, and how does it relate to hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A22- Fisher's F-Test in R Programming | GeeksforGeeksThe F-test is a statistical test that compares variances between two or more groups, primarily used in hypothesis testing to determine if there's a significant difference in means. It's related to hypothesis testing because it helps us decide whether to reject the null hypothesis of equal variances or equal means (depending on the context).\n",
